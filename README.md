# Alzheimer-ML-Python-Project
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical images into four Alzheimer's-related categories. It applies data augmentation for training and evaluates performance with a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics. The model supports diagnosis by assisting in medical image analysis.
